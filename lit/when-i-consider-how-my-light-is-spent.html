    <p>Historical/cultural context:</p>

  <p>Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
<a href="#popup2" class="popup-link">Explain me</a>

  </p>

  <h2>Ere half my days in this dark world and wide</h2>
  <p>Word notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ere: before</li>
    <li>Half my days: halfway through my life</li>
    <li>Dark world and wide: a metaphor for a difficult and expansive world</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Paraphrase:</p>
  <p>Before I reach the halfway point of my life in this difficult and expansive world</p>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p>The speaker is lamenting the fact that they have already used up a significant portion of their life and they have not
    achieved much in a world that they perceive to be difficult and wide-ranging.</p>

  <p>And that one talent which is death to hide,
<a href="#popup3" class="popup-link">Explain me</a>

  </p>
  <div id="popup3" class="popup">
  <h2>And that one talent which is death to hide</h2>
  <p>Word notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talent: a skill or ability</li>
    <li>Death to hide: a metaphor for burying or wasting one's talent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Paraphrase:</p>
  <p>And the one talent that I have, which would be a waste to bury or waste</p>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p>The speaker is referring to their own talents and abilities and suggesting that it would be a waste to hide or waste
    them. The phrase "death to hide" suggests that burying one's talent is as bad as dying with it unused.</p>
  <p>Historical/cultural context:</p>
  <p>The poem was written during the 17th century, a time when the concept of personal talent and individuality was
    becoming increasingly important in English society.</p>

  <p>Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
<a href="#popup4" class="popup-link">Explain me</a>

  </p>
  <div id="popup4" class="popup">
  <h2>Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent</h2>
  <p>Word notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lodged: dwelling within</li>
    <li>Useless: unproductive or wasted</li>
    <li>Bent: inclined or determined</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Paraphrase:</p>
  <p>Even though my soul is more determined, my talent remains within me, unproductive and wasted.</p>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p>The speaker is expressing frustration that their talent remains unexpressed despite their strong desire to use it. The
    phrase "lodged with me useless" suggests that the talent is trapped within the speaker and cannot be put to use.</p>
  <p>Historical/cultural context:</p>
  <p>The poem reflects on the author's own personal struggles with his blindness and the loss of his talent as a writer and
    intellectual during a time of political and religious upheaval in England.</p>

<a href="#popup6" class="popup-link">Explain me</a>

  </p>
  <div id="popup6" class="popup">
  <h2>My true account, lest he returning chide;</h2>

    <li>True account: an accurate record of his actions</li>
    <li>Chide: scold or rebuke</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Paraphrase:</p>
  <p>I want to offer an accurate record of my actions to God, lest He scold me when He returns.</p>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p>The speaker wants to use his talent to serve God and present it as an offering to Him so that he can give an honest
    account of his life and actions. The phrase "lest he returning chide" suggests that the speaker wants to avoid being
    rebuked by God for failing to use his talent to serve Him.</p>

  <p>"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"
<a href="#popup7" class="popup-link">Explain me</a>

  <div id="popup7" class="popup">
  <h2>"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"</h2>
  <p>Word notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Doth: does</li>
    <li>Exact: demand</li>
    <li>Day-labour: hard work during the day</li>
    <li>Light denied: a reference to the speaker's blindness</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Paraphrase:</p>
  <p>Does God demand that I work hard during the day, even though I am blind?</p>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p>The speaker is questioning whether God expects him to work hard during the day, despite his blindness. The phrase "light
    denied" suggests that the speaker feels limited or handicapped in some way, and is questioning whether God would still
    demand that he work as if he had full sight.</p>
  <p>Historical/cultural context:</p>
  <p>The poem reflects the author's personal struggles with blindness and his attempts to reconcile his physical limitations
    with his religious beliefs. The question of whether God expects the same level of productivity from everyone, regardless
    of their abilities, was a common theological debate at the time.</p>

  <p>I fondly ask. But patience, to prevent
<a href="#popup8" class="popup-link">Explain me</a>

  </p>
  <div id="popup8" class="popup">

  <ul>
    <li>Fondly: foolishly or with excessive affection</li>
    <li>Patience: the ability to remain calm and composed in the face of difficulties</li>
    <li>To prevent: to avoid or avert</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Paraphrase:</p>
  <p>I foolishly ask this question. But I need to be patient and avoid becoming anxious or frustrated.</p>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p>The speaker acknowledges that his previous question about whether God expects him to work hard despite his blindness was
    a foolish one. However, he reminds himself to be patient and calm, and to avoid becoming anxious or frustrated about
    his situation.</p>
  <p>Historical/cultural context:</p>
  <p>The poem reflects the author's struggles with blindness and his attempts to find meaning and purpose in his life despite
    his physical limitations. The emphasis on patience and acceptance of one's circumstances was a common theme in Christian

  </p>
  <div id="popup9" class="popup">

    expects him to work hard despite his blindness. The response is that God does not need anything from him, and is a
    reflection of the idea that God is self-sufficient and does not require anything from humanity.</p>

    <li>His own gifts: natural talents or abilities</li>
    <li>Who best: who performs the best or achieves the most</li>
  </ul>

    despite his blindness. He wonders whether it is through his own efforts or natural abilities that he can achieve the
    most.</p>
  <p>Historical/cultural context:</p>

  <p>His state is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,
<a href="#popup11" class="popup-link">Explain me</a>

  </p>
  <div id="popup11" class="popup">
  <h2>His state is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed</h2>
  <p>Word notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>State: condition or situation</li>
    <li>Kingly: royal or majestic</li>
    <li>Thousands: many people or things</li>

  <p>They also serve who only stand and wait."
<a href="#popup12" class="popup-link">Explain me</a>

  </p>
  <div id="popup12" class="popup">
  <h2>They also serve who only stand and wait.</h2>
  <p>Word notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Serve: help or assist</li>
    <li>Stand: remain stationary or inactive</li>
    <li>Wait: stay in one place for a period of time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Paraphrase:</p>
  <p>Even those who simply remain stationary and wait can still be of service.</p>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p>The speaker suggests that service to others can take many forms, including waiting patiently and offering support or
    encouragement to those who are active in the world. This idea is particularly meaningful in the context of the speaker's
    blindness, which limits his ability to participate in traditional forms of service or activity.</p>
  <p>Historical/cultural context:</p>
  <p>The poem reflects the author's struggles with blindness and his attempts to find meaning and purpose in his life despite
    his physical limitations. The idea that even those who are unable to participate fully in the world can still make a
    meaningful contribution was an important theme in Renaissance literature and philosophy.</p>
