          Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
          Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
          Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
          And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
          Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
          And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
          And every fair from fair sometime declines,
          By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;
          But thy eternal summer shall not fade
          Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
          Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,
          When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
          So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
          So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
